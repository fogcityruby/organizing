Welcome to SF.rb's organizing repo. We use issues to keep track of upcoming meetups.

`ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` has the template that we use to start planning new meetups.

SF.rb (pronounced “sf dot rb”) is a monthly meetup where Rubyists and their friends come to talk about programming. We host short (5-7 minute) and long (20 min) talks on topics ranging from Ruby itself to Ruby-adjacent topics, like devops, front end, human beings, or others!

Speakers of all programming and speaking experience levels are welcome to submit talks, and we’re especially excited to host speakers who come from populations that are underrepresented in tech.

We are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. All attendees are expected to abide by the SF.rb code of conduct. The full Code of Conduct can be found here: http://sfdotrb.github.io/

You should submit a talk proposal!
